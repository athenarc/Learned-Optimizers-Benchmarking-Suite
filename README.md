## Setup

This repository serves as a **testbed for evaluating learned query optimizers (LQOs)**.
Our experimental environment consisted of two main components:

1. **CPU-only server:**
   Hosted multiple Docker environments (each with 40 GB of shared memory) running PostgreSQL v12.5 instances. These instances acted as the execution backends for the learned query optimizers.

2. **GPU server:**
   Used to train and run each LQO implementation.

For most users, it is **not necessary** to replicate this multi-server configuration. A single machine with Docker installed and GPU access is sufficient for experimentation.

Refer to the [setup guide](docker_instructions.md) for detailed instructions on building, configuring, and managing Docker containers.
Each optimizer may require specific dependencies or database configurationsâ€”please consult the corresponding README files listed below.

## Learned Query Optimizers

This repository integrates multiple state-of-the-art learned query optimizers.
Setup instructions, additional notes, and guidance on loading checkpoints for each experiment are provided below:

* **NEO:** See [optimizers/balsa/README.md](optimizers/balsa/README.md)
  *(Note: NEO is executed through the Balsa codebase, as the official NEO implementation was not publicly released.)*

* **BAO:** See [optimizers/BaoForPostgreSQL/README.md](optimizers/BaoForPostgreSQL/README.md)

* **LOGER:** See [optimizers/LOGER/README.md](optimizers/LOGER/README.md)

* **FASTgres:** See [optimizers/FASTgres-PVLDBv16/README.md](optimizers/FASTgres-PVLDBv16/README.md)

* **LERO:** See [optimizers/Lero-on-PostgreSQL/README.md](optimizers/Lero-on-PostgreSQL/README.md)
  *(Note: LERO requires non-default PostgreSQL configurations; refer to its README for setup details.)*

## Experiments

Our evaluation framework examines several key aspects of learned query optimizer performance.
Each experiment directory includes documentation describing its objectives, methodology, and any special database configurations required.

1. [(E1) End-to-End Performance & Value Model Fidelity](experiments/experiment1/README.md)
2. [(E2) Sensitivity & Execution Stability](experiments/experiment2/README.md)
3. [(E3) Learning Trajectory & Convergence](experiments/experiment3/README.md)
4. [(E4) Internal Decision-Making & Plan Representation](experiments/experiment4/README.md)
5. [(E5) Generalization to Novel Conditions](experiments/experiment5/README.md)

---

## Models

We provide pretrained model checkpoints for each experiment and optimizer in the following Hugging Face repository:
ðŸ‘‰ [**LQO Evaluation Suite Models**](https://huggingface.co/EDBT-2026-Submission/LQO_Evaluation_Suite/tree/main)

Please refer to each optimizerâ€™s documentation for detailed instructions on which model checkpoint to load for each experiment.

The results of each experiment, along with the figures reported in the publication, are available in the Jupyter notebooks below:
- [Experiment 1](experiments/experiment1/experiment1.ipynb)
- [Experiment 2](experiments/experiment2/experiment2.ipynb)

## Utility Scripts

The `preprocessing` directory contains a separate repository implementing utility tools for supporting experiments. These include:

* An SQL parser
* Scripts to transform workloads into directories compatible with our experiment structure
* Programs to calculate workload distributions (as used in Experiment E5)
* PostgreSQL warm-up calls
* Additional miscellaneous utilities

For more details, refer to the [preprocessing README](preprocessing/README.md).
